# ESP32WaterMonitor
A simple project that uses an ESP32 to poll an Ultrasonic Sensor to get the current level in a water tank using the JSN-SRT04 Ultrasonic Sensor and posting it's measurements to a Firebase Cloud Firestore.

The code for this project makes heavy use of mobizt's FirebaseClient library. I have to also thank him for his help when I was debugging issues with the code.
